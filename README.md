** Simple To_Do_ Application **
The Simple ToDo App is an Android application developed during my internship .
It allows users to add, view, edit, and delete tasks, with all data stored locally on the device. 
The app is built using Java and the Android SDK, providing a clean and intuitive user interface for managing daily tasks efficiently.
